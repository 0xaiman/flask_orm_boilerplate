Here's a `README.md` tailored for your Flask backend boilerplate, focusing on how to use it as a backend template and guidance on where to start, modify, and implement business logic.

# Flask Blueprint Boilerplate

This repository provides a scalable and modular boilerplate for building a Flask backend using Blueprints, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, and PostgreSQL for the database. This template is designed to help you kickstart your web application development with a clean structure and organized components.

## Features

- Modular architecture using Blueprints for organization
- Integrated Flask-SQLAlchemy for easy database interactions
- Database migration support with Flask-Migrate
- Simple error handling
- Basic test setup for routes
- Optional Docker support for containerization

## Getting Started

To set up this boilerplate for your own project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask_blueprint_boilerplate.git
   cd flask_blueprint_boilerplate
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Environment:**
   Update the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials and secret key.

4. **Initialize the Database:**
   Run migrations to set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Project Structure

The boilerplate is structured as follows:

```
/flask_blueprint_boilerplate
├── /app                  # Application code
│   ├── /models           # Database models
│   ├── /routes           # API routes (Blueprints)
│   ├── /services         # Business logic and services
│   ├── __init__.py       # App initialization
├── /migrations           # Database migration scripts
├── /tests                # Test cases
├── config.py             # Configuration settings
├── manage.py             # Script for managing the app and migrations
├── requirements.txt      # Project dependencies
└── .env                  # Environment variables
```

## Modifying the Boilerplate

### Models

- **Location:** `/app/models/`
- **Usage:** Define your database models here. The provided `User` model is an example. You can create additional models as needed, ensuring they inherit from `db.Model`.

### Routes

- **Location:** `/app/routes/`
- **Usage:** The `main.py` file contains the main routes for your application. You can create new Python files for additional Blueprints (e.g., `user_routes.py` for user-related endpoints) and register them in the app’s `__init__.py`.

### Services

- **Location:** `/app/services/`
- **Usage:** This directory is for implementing your business logic. For example, you might create a service for user authentication, data processing, or integrating third-party APIs.

## Implementing Business Logic

To implement business logic, follow these guidelines:

1. **Create Service Classes:**
   Define service classes in the `/app/services/` directory that handle specific functionality. For example, a `UserService` might include methods for creating, updating, and deleting users.

2. **Call Services in Routes:**
   In your route handlers, import the necessary service classes and call their methods to perform actions. For instance, in a user registration route, you could call a method from `UserService` to handle user creation.

3. **Use Database Models:**
   Utilize the models you defined in `/app/models/` to interact with the database through the SQLAlchemy ORM. You can query, add, update, and delete records using these models.

## Running the Application

To run the Flask application locally, execute:

```bash
flask run
```

If you are using Docker, build and run the container with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Testing

The boilerplate includes a basic test setup using `pytest`. You can run tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

Add your test cases in the `/tests/` directory to ensure your application behaves as expected.
